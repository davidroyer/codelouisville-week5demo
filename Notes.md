# JavaScript Functions

You can think of the purpose and strategy of functions in many different ways.

-   Functions are like similar to storage products we might use to provide
    some system and help to the organization of our things.

-   If you think of a bookshelf that you will use to place many objects on, you
    might want to get some bins or containers that can then house a subset of
    those things. This allows us decompartmentalize these object into groups that
    make sense to us.
