# Code Louisville - Functions Demo

This is the code for the that was used in the Week 5 Functions Demo.
The primary file of interest in the `src/js/button-tracker.js` file.

**Please Note:**

This template was not created by me personally and I can't recommend using
anything in this project other than the `button-tracker.js` file as a reference
or example of how to do things or best practices.

## FYI

> Below is the code that was included in this template's README orignally

### Getting started

-   First, ensure that node.js & npm are both installed. If not, choose your OS and installation method from [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow the instructions.
-   Nextk, use your command line to enter your project directory.
-   This template comes with a ready-to-use package file called `package-sample.json`. You just need to rename it to `package.json`, then run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies into your project.

You're ready to go! Run any task by typing `npm run task` (where "task" is the name of the task in the `"scripts"` object). The most useful task for rapid development is `watch`. It will start a new server, open up a browser and watch for any SCSS or JS changes in the `src` directory; once it compiles those changes, the browser will automatically inject the changed file(s)!
